### üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Aaryan Kapoor

AI/ML Engineer | Honors College Student @ UNLV
**B.S. Computer Science** with minors in **Math, Data Science, and AI**

> **"Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make."**
> 
> **- Nick Bostrom**


I‚Äôve built several MVPs for startups, worked on LLM engineering research, and scaled ML project costs from **\$50,000 to \$250** with a **6.7√ó inference speedup**. I specialize in building **AI agents**, **reasoning-enhanced LLMs**, and **RAG systems** for real-world deployment. I read and implement research papers daily to stay on the cutting edge of AI.

### üöÄ Projects & Experience

* Built a first of its kind **toggleable reasoning LLM**, replicating DeepSeek's GRPO functionality
* Created **Xio**, an AI automated voice-to-voice real-time interview agent with function calling deployed on Azure with OpenAI & Google APIs
* Delivered 40+ **agentic AI workflows** using CrewAI, LangChain, and OpenRouter
* Designed secure **USB-deployed LLM tools** for cybersecurity simulations
* Developed **AI-powered web scraping tools**, reducing processing time by 6.7x
* Built a **Doom-playing AI** with PPO and CNN-based RL using VizDoom
